            <li id="1">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What is the difference between my medical plan's deductible and my dental plan deductible?</h3>
                <p class="answers">Both a medical deductible and a dental deductible are similar in that there is a set amount you have to pay before some services are covered. For dental plans, a deductible ranges from $25 to sometimes $100. Once you meet this amount in a plan year, you no longer have a deductible to pay. Medical plans on the other hand can have a deductible that ranges from hundreds to thousands of dollars that must be paid out of pocket before some procedures may be covered. </p>
            </li>
            <li id="2">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What is a dental deductible?</h3>
                <p class="answers">A dental deductible is a set dollar amount you are required to pay before your dental plan starts to help pay. You will pay your dentist for any non-preventive dental care until you meet this plan deductible.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="3">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">I have never had to pay a bill for my dentist, why am I paying a bill now?</h3>
                <p class="answers">It is likely you have only had preventive services such as cleansings, which are commonly covered in full by most plans. Other procedures are typically covered but will leave you with an out-of-pocket balance.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="4">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What is an annual maximum benefit?</h3>
                <p class="answers">The total dollar amount that a dental plan will pay for dental care incurred by an individual or family (under a family plan) in a specified benefit period, typically a calendar year.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="5">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">I have a lifetime maximum on my plan. What is that?</h3>
                <p class="answers">The lifetime maximum is the maximum dollar amount your plan will ever pay toward the cost of specific dental services. The most common dental services with lifetime maximums are orthodontic treatment and TMJ.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="6">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">My plan states some benefits are covered at 100%. Why did I still have to pay for services?</h3>
                <p class="answers">Although your benefits may be covered at 100%, many things come into play. The two most common reasons where you would still pay for a service, are if you have met your max benefits, and you have no more benefits, or if you’re still in a waiting period for that particular service.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="7">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What is an annual waiting period?</h3>
                <p class="answers">A waiting period is the amount of time you must wait before some or all of your coverage comes into effect. You may not receive benefits for claims filed during the waiting period. Waiting periods may also be known as elimination periods and qualifying periods. </p>
            </li>
            <li id="8">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">How do I know if my dentist is in network with my dental plan?</h3>
                <p class="answers">You can verify with your provider, they will have to call your insurance and check. You can also call your insurance yourself and provide them with your provider’s information, typically the provider’s NPI.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="9">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">Whats the difference between in network and contracted?</h3>
                <p class="answers">If a provider is in-network with your insurance it means that they are contracted with your insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="10">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What happens if my provider is out of network with my insurance?</h3>
                <p class="answers">If your provider is out of network, check if your insurance has out-of-network benefits. If so, benefits will likely be less than in-network providers. If you have no out-of-network benefits, you will likely have to pay the provider’s fees for treatment.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="11">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What does my dental insurance mean by type of service?</h3>
                <p class="answers">With dental insurances, there are different forms of services. These include preventative treatment, basic restorative treatment, major restorative treatment, and orthodontic treatment. Many times you will not see a bill because basic cleanings are covered under preventative treatment, but all coverage differs based on the type of service that is planned.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="12">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">IV sedation is covered under my plan, but I still had to pay full price?</h3>
                <p class="answers">IV sedation is often a covered form of anesthesia in an office setting. With IV sedation, if you ask if it is covered, many times you will be told yes, but there are usually specific guidelines that need to be met for actual coverage. Typically IV sedation is not covered unless it’s an impacted tooth extraction or a procedure where your insurance deems it medically necessary. When checking IV sedation benefits also ask for the guidelines and specify what codes are also being billed during that procedure.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="13">
                <h3 class="questionsBeforeAnswer">What is an EOB/ Explanation of Benefits</h3>
                <p class="answers">An EOB is a statement from your health insurance company providing details on payment for a medical service you received. Typically will break down what they covered, and what you likely out of pocket can be. This is not a bill from your medical provider. </p>
